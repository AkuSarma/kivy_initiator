# <h1 align="center">kivy_initiator</h1>
It does the initial work of creating a new kivy project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkuSarma/kivy_initiator.git
cd kivy_initiator
python main.py
```
**What it does**
* At first it will ask you the name of the project and the directory in which you want to create the project
* If left blank set the name to kivy_initiator and take the current working directory as the project path.
* Then it will create a folder there with the name of your project 
* Which contains two files namely main.py and name.kv(name = name of your project).
* Both the files will contain the initial required imports that are common in all the kivy projects.
